Programming Language: Python

Structure of the code:

A single python file is developed named compute_a_posteriori.py. In this code, posterior probabilities of different hypotheses, probability of next observations are calculated.

The result will get updated in a new file named result.txt


Libraries used:
sys: Used this library to interact the python file with the command line arguments, sys.argv provides the access for it.

Need to run the code from terminal (command_line_argument)


the order to follow to run the code is--> compute_a_posteriori observations

Example to run the code:

--> python compute_a_posteriori.py CCCCC

--> python compute_a_posteriori.py LCLCLCLC
